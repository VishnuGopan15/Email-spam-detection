#About The Project


Spam detection is the process of identifying and filtering out unwanted or unsolicited messages, typically in the form of emails or text messages. These messages are often sent by spammers or malicious actors with the intent of promoting a product, service, or website, or to trick the recipient into providing personal information or downloading malware. Spam detection typically involves the use of machine learning algorithms that can analyze the content of messages and identify patterns or characteristics that are commonly associated with spam. These algorithms can be trained on large datasets of labeled examples of spam and legitimate messages, allowing them to learn to distinguish between the two with a high degree of accuracy. Effective spam detection is an important task for both individuals and organizations, as it can help to prevent unwanted messages from cluttering inboxes, reduce the risk of phishing attacks, and improve overall cybersecurity.

This repository contains a Python script that uses various machine learning models to classify spam messages from ham messages. The model is trained on a Popular dataset of Spam emails and we use multiple machine learning models for classification.
